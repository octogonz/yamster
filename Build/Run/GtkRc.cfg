# GtkRc.cfg for Windows
#
# This file allows you to customize the visual appearance of the Yamster
# application.  For example, if you need to resize the text to make it 
# easier to read, or if you need to select certain fonts for an international
# language, you can do it by editing this file.  You can also bedizen the UI
# by changing theme properties such as colors and spacing.
#
# This is a resource file for the GTK library.  Unfortunately the file format
# is largely undocumented, and any errors are silently ignored by GTK.
# When looking for answers, beware that the newer GTK 3 has some syntax
# differences from GTK 2 used by Yamster.  You might start with these articles:

    # For uncommon Unicode symbols (e.g. the cool glyphs that people use in
    # their Yammer names), normal Windows apps automatically fall back to 
    # the "Segoe UI Symbol" font for any characters missing from the active
    # font.  For GTK's Pango rendering library, we have to specify this 
    # explicitly.  This is done by specifying a list of fonts (to be tried
    # in order) separated  by commas.  The font size is appended at the end.

    # cause glitches (e.g. missing cursor and improper spacing for blank lines).
    # For Yamster, the workaround seems to be to eliminate the 
    # "segoe ui symbol" fallback font for this control.  See discussion here:
